• Experiences and Strengths: Explain how this course will help you in reaching your 
professional goals.
This course will help me in a multitude of ways as I begin to strive for my professional goals. 
Most notably, this course has taught me how to overcome technical and life issues as they 
arise. I say this because I had to overcome a ton during this semester from having to restart 
from scratch as my system failed me, to illnesses in the family. On a more technical side, this 
course did a great job teaching me the serverless concept and how full stack applications work 
within them. This course also taught me a lot about containers and Docker compose, and the 
ways in which they interact within the project. Also, this course did a great job in teaching me 
how to navigate and use AWS as a whole. Though there are still plenty of portions within AWS 
that weren’t discussed, the foundation laid here will help me better understand the ones it left 
out. These skills make me a more marketable job applicant.
• What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become 
a more marketable candidate in your career field?
The skills learned and developed within this course will help me become more marketable in a 
few ways. Most importantly, learning how to navigate and properly use AWS is a huge 
advantage as that’s where most companies are turning to. The understanding of containers and 
Docker composition that came from this course will allow me to bring a better understanding of 
the concepts to any company looking for this specialty. Overall, this course has taught me how 
to migrate a full stack application to a cloud provider, extremely valuable knowledge in this job 
market. 
• Describe your strengths as a software developer.
My strengths as a software developer are really understanding the design principles instilled in 
me during my time here at SNHU (Southern New Hampshire University). I can couple that with 
my experience working as a software design tester to more easily relate to issues that arise. 
Aside from these, I have also learned proper ways to debug code, time management skills to 
ensure I do not miss deadlines, and to be more patient. 
• Identify the types of roles you are prepared to assume in a new job.
Roles I am prepared to assume in a new job include software design testing, full stack 
development, data migration, AWS cloud practitioner, database analyst, information security 
analyst, etc. There are too many to name them all. 
• Planning for Growth: Synthesize the knowledge you have gathered about cloud 
services.
Cloud services allow workers to remotely work on a project from anywhere in the world using 
shared, online resources. Cloud services allow the end user to drastically cut costs as they do 
not need to buy and maintain servers to run their application. Also, cloud servers inevitably 
offer another layer of security to the project. 
• Identify various ways that microservices or serverless may be used to produce 
efficiencies of management and scale in your web application in the future. Consider the 
following:
Microservices and serverless are designed to allow scalability at an exceptionally low cost
compared to the alternatives. Microservices allow you to write code for each function, which
allows each function to be scaled as needed, independently of the other functions. It also 
allows issues to become less destructive and easier to correct as each function works 
independently from the others. 
• How would you handle scale and error handling?
When looking at scale and error handling it is important to note that microservices make it 
quite easy to correct errors as they arise, and, since functions are separate from each other, 
prevents one error from bringing down the entire system. Also, microservices allow each 
function to be scaled as needed, independent of the other functions. As issues arise, the minute 
nature of microservices make it easier to determine where the issue is coming from, thus, 
correcting it is easier too. As I have not seen every issue, if one arises that I am unfamiliar with I 
would first ask my team internally, if no one can determine the issue, I would look online at 
how others have dealt with the same, or similar, issues. From here, I would test and document 
my changes until the issue is resolved, then I would save the notes I wrote just in case this issue 
comes back. Also, Elastic Load Balancing would allow me to redirect traffic to various zones that 
are unaffected by the issue, this will reduce customers downtime.
• How would you predict the cost?
In order to predict cost I would first determine the needs of the project. After the needs are 
determined, I would need to determine the approximate amount of time each service would be 
in use, I would always determine this number on the higher side as you never know when 
emergencies will arise. I would also take advantage of the free test time as this would give a 
very accurate determination of what resources the project would normally consume during a 
specific amount of time. EC2 pricing would be extremely helpful with this.
• What is more cost predictable, containers or serverless?
I believe that containers are more cost predictable than serverless as once the code is written 
and the container is running there is little chance of over usage. Also, if errors arise it is easier 
to correct them from a container as opposed to serverless. Also, since each container runs 
independent of each other, one going down would not compromise the others. Serverless is 
also very predictable, however, you could leave services running unknowingly, thus running up 
the cost. Also, during peak seasons the cost of serverless will be greater than at other times of 
the year. For these reasons, I still believe that containers are more predictable, just not by 
much.
• Explain several pros and cons that would be deciding factors in plans for expansion.
When it comes to planning for expansion, there are numerous factors to look at. Most notably, 
the cost and time to implement the expansion. With traditional methods, these costs could be 
astronomical, however, with serverless computing these have both been reduced to a fraction 
of the cost and time. Accessibility and security are also major deciding factors. Your project 
needs to be accessible to all major platforms and your customers need peace of mind knowing 
that their information is secure. As you expand, these become more prevalent. On the one
hand there will be, in theory, more traffic. On the other hand, expansion can lead to 
vulnerabilities within your system going unnoticed. Also, continuous delivery will help minimize 
bugs, defects, errors, etc. 
• What roles do elasticity and pay-for-service play in decision making for planned future 
growth?
Elasticity and pay-for-service play integral roles in planning for growth. Cloud computing has 
made scalability nearly infinite, thus scaling to the needs of the business is easier than it has 
ever been. Elasticity allows resources to be changed to meet the needs of the company, 
without much hassle or expense. Pay-for-service allows you to only pay for the resources you 
need, and only when they are in use. Instead of paying for all resources 24/7, this allows you to 
select which resources are used and only pay for them while they’re in use. These are integral 
when deciding how to plan for future growth as it puts the entire scope of the company at your 
fingertips and allows the costs to be micromanaged to the millisecond.
